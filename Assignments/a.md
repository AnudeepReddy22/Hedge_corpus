### 1.3 The Stock Market

### 1.3.1 OHLC

It refers to the stock’s open, high, low and close price for a certain time period.
### 1.3.2 Market Capitalisation

Market capitalization is the aggregate valuation of the company based on its current share price and the total number of outstanding stocks. It is calculated by multiplying the current market price of the company's share with the total outstanding shares of the company.

For instance, a company has 20 million outstanding shares and the current market price of each share is Rs100. Market capitalization of this company will be 200,00,000 x 100=Rs 200 crore.

### 1.6 Technical Analysis

Technical Analysis seeks to predict price movement by examining historical data, mainly price and volume. Most Technical analysis is focussed on determining whether or not a current trend will continue and if not, will it reverse.

### 1.6.1 Support and Resistance

The support price is a price at which one can expect more buyers than sellers. Likewise, the resistance price is a price at which one can expect more sellers than buyers. The resistance level is always above the current market price. The support level is always below the current market price.
### 1.6.2 Indicators

A technical indicator helps a trader analyse the price movement of security. Indicators are independent trading systems introduced to the world by successful traders. Indicators are built on pre-set logic using which traders can supplement their technical study (Candlesticks, Volumes, S&R) to arrive at a trading decision. Indicators help in buying, selling, confirming trends, and sometimes predicting trends.

2. Option Theory in Trading
The term ‘option’ refers to a financial instrument that is based on the value of underlying securities such as stocks and indexes. Each contract will have a specific expiration date by which the holder must exercise their option. The stated price on an option is known as the strike price.
Call Option
The buyer of the call option has the right, but not the obligation to buy an agreed quantity of a particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying) from the seller of the option at a certain time (the expiration date) for a certain price (the strike price).
2.1 Long Call Option
Long Call option' is the most basic & simplest strategy. It is implemented when we expect the underlying asset to show significant upside move i.e., this is a directional strategy where we are bullish on the market direction.Buying a Call or Long
Call is the same as future but capped with downside risk and requires less margin for implementation.
2.2 Short Call Option
Short Call option is a simple but risky strategy & hence qualified as an advanced strategy. Short Call or Selling Call is recommended when the price of the underlying asset is expected to fall & the stock is not expected to rise further or remain sideways. Generally, we expect the price to stay below the sold strike price.
Put Option
Put option is a derivative contract between two parties. The buyer of the put option earns a right (it is not an obligation) to exercise his option to sell a particular asset to the put option seller for a stipulated period of time.
### 2.3 Long Put Option

Long Put option' is again the most basic & simplest strategy among all. It is recommended or implemented when we expect the underlying asset to show significant downside move in near term i.e., this is directional strategy where we are bearish on the market direction. Buying a Put

or Long Put is the same as the future but capped with upside risk and requires less margin for implementation.

### 2.4 Short Put Option

Short Put option is a simple but risky strategy & hence qualified as an advanced strategy. Short Put or Selling Put is recommended when the price of the underlying asset is expected to rise & the stock is not expected to fall further and remain sideways. Generally, we expect the price to stay above the sold strike price.

3. Black Scholes Model
Black-Scholes is a pricing model used to determine the fair price or theoretical value for a Call or a Put option.
The quantum of speculation is more in case of stock market derivatives and proper pricing of options eliminates the opportunity for any arbitrage.
The model is used to determine the price of a European call option which simply means that the option can only be exercised on the expiration date.
Though usually accurate, the Black-Scholes model makes certain assumptions that can lead to prices that deviate from the real-world results.
The Black-Scholes model requires five input variables: the strike price of an option, the current stock price, the time to expiration, the risk-free interest rate, and the volatility.
The formula for Black-Scholes Model is a given below:

3.1 Derivatives Greeks
The variables that are used to assess risk in the options market are commonly referred to as the Greeks. Each Greek variable is a result of an imperfect assumption or relationship of the option with another underlying variable. Greeks are used by options traders and portfolio managers to understand how their options investments will behave as prices move, and to hedge their positions accordingly.
### 3.1.1 Delta

Delta is a ratio that relates changes in the price of a security such as company stock to a change in the price of a derivative of that stock.

Consider that you have a stock worth Rs. 5428 and a Call option on that stock is worth Rs.170. Further assume that the delta is 0.50. This indicates that the value of the Option is expected to rise by 0.50 Rs. for every 1 Rs. increase in the price of the

stock. If the stock price moves to Rs. 5448, then the value of the option becomes Rs.180.

### 3.1.2 Theta

The term theta refers to the rate of decline in the value of an option due to the passage of time. It can also be referred to as the time decay of an option. This means an option loses value as time moves closer to its maturity as long as everything is held constant. Theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an option's value declines every day.

A theta of -6.70 means that Option will lose 6.70 on a daily basis if all other factors are held constant.

### 3.1.3 Gamma

Gamma is the first derivative of delta and is used when trying to gauge the price movement of an option, relative to the amount it is in or out of the money. In that same regard, gamma is the second derivative of an option's price with respect to the underlying price. Gamma is the rate of change in an option's delta per 1-point move in the underlying asset's price

4. Option Strategies
4.1 Butterfly Strategy
A butterfly is a limited risk, non-directional options strategy that is designed to have a high probability of earning a limited profit when the future volatility of the underlying asset is expected to be lower or higher than that asset's current implied volatility.
4.1.1 Long Call Butterfly
expiration date.
4.1.2 Short Call Butterfly
This strategy makes profit if the underlying stock is at the body of the butterfly at expiration. Combining two short calls at a middle strike, and one long call each at a lower and upper strike creates a long call butterfly. The upper and lower strikes (wings) must both be equidistant from the middle strike (body), and all the options must have the same
This strategy profits if the underlying stock is outside the wings of the butterfly at expiration. A short call butterfly consists of two long calls at a middle strike and short one call each at a lower and upper strike. The upper and lower strikes (wings) must both be equidistant from the middle strike (body), and all the options must have the same expiration date.
4.1.3 Long Put Butterfly
This strategy profits if underlying stock is at body of the butterfly at expiration. A long-put butterfly is composed of two short puts at a middle strike, and long one put each at a lower and a higher strike. The upper and lower strikes(wings) must both be equidistant from the middle strike (body), and all the options must be the same expiration.
### 4.1.4 Short Put Butterfly

This strategy profits if the underlying stock is outside the wings of the butterfly at expiration. Buying two puts at a middle strike, and selling one put each at a lower and upper strike results in a short put butterfly. The upper and lower strikes (wings) must both be equidistant from the middle strike (body), and all the options must be the same expiration.

### 4.1.5 Modified Call Butterfly

Modified Call Butterfly is similar to Long Call Butterfly, but the difference between the strike of the middle Call and the higher Long Call is smaller than the difference between the strike of the lower Call and the other middle Call. Consequently, the profit is maximised when the share price closes close to the

middle components’ strike price. This strategy requires the investor to pay close attention to details. To establish the position, the trader must buy a lower strike ITM Long Call, sell two middle ATM Short Calls, and buy a higher strike OTM Long Call. The investor can profit from increasing share prices or the share prices moving within given limits.

### 4.1.6 Modified Put Butterfly

### 4.2 Straddle Strategy

A straddle is an options strategy involving the purchase of both a put and call option for the same expiration date and strike price on the same underlying security. The strategy is profitable only when the stock either rises or falls from the strike price by more than the total premium paid.

### 4.2.1 Long Straddle

This strategy consists of buying a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration. A long straddle is a combination of buying a call and buying a put, both with the same strike price and expiration. Together, they produce a position that should profit if the stock makes a big move either up or down.Typically, investors buy the straddle because they predict

a big price move and/or a great deal of volatility in the near future.
### 4.2.2 Short Straddle

This strategy involves selling a call option and a put option with the same expiration and strike price. A short straddle is a combination of writing uncovered calls (bearish) and writing uncovered puts (bullish), both with the same strike price and expiration. Together, they produce a

position that predicts a narrow trading range for the underlying stock.

### 4.3 Condor Strategy

A condor is a limited-risk, non-directional options trading strategy consisting of four options at four different strike prices.

- Short Call Condor

A short call condor is a four-leg strategy that is created by selling one call at a lower strike price, buying one call with a higher strike price, buying another call with an even higher strike price and selling one more call with an even higher strike price. All calls have the same expiration date, and the strike prices are equidistant.

- Short Put Condor

A short put condor is a four-part strategy that is created by selling one put at a higher strike price, buying one put with a lower strike price, buying another put with an even

### 4.4 Spread Strategy

lower strike price and selling one more put with an even lower strike price. All puts have the same expiration date, and the strike prices are equidistant.

A strategy that involves a position in one or more options so that the cost of buying an option is funded entirely or in part by selling another option in the same underlying.
### 4.4.1 Call Ratio Backspread

downside losses.

### 4.4.2 Put Ratio Backspread

A call ratio backspread is a bullish options strategy that involves buying calls and then selling calls of different strike price but same expiration, using a ratio of 1:2, 1:3, or 2:3. In the long call ratio backspread, more calls are purchased than are sold. A call backspread is a bullish spread strategy that seeks to gain from a rising market, while limiting potential

A put ratio backspread is an options trading strategy that combines short puts and long puts to create a position whose profit and loss potential depends on the ratio of these puts. Put ratio spread is constructed to have unlimited potential profit with limited loss, or limited potential profit with the prospect of unlimited loss, depending

on how it is structured. The ratio of long to short puts in a put ratio backspread is typically 2:1, 3:2 or 3:1.

### 4.4.3 Ratio Call Spread

A call ratio spread involves buying one ATM or OTM call option, while also selling or writing two call options that are further OTM at higher strike.

### 4.4.4 Ratio Put Spread

A put ratio spread is buying one ATM or OTM put option, while also writing two further options that are further OTM at lower strike.
